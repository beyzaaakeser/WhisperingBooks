<h1>My WhisperingBooks Website</h1>

I created a modern web application that allows users to easily find the books they are looking for by accessing the vast book database of the "Google Books API." Users can browse books presented with card structures that include images, authors, language, and short descriptions of the books. With the dynamic routing feature of "React Router," users can easily access detailed information about the books. While a customizable design is achieved with "SASS," real-time book data is provided by making API calls with "Axios." It is also possible to search and find books by a specific word thanks to the search bar on the home page. Our application has a responsive design that is compatible with all screen sizes.
